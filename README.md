# Lisp language support in Atom

Originally converted from [Texmate lisp bundle](https://github.com/textmate/lisp.tmbundle) as explained in the [atom guide](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle). However some work to properly customize this package for Atom is still needed.

Lisp is a big family of programming languages. This particular package is intended for the most popular Lisp dialect -- the Common Lisp.

For proper lisp indentation and better lisp-editing experience this package should be used in conjunction with some advanced lisp editing tool:
- Parinfer (suitable for beginners and gurus alike)
- [Paredit](https://atom.io/packages/lisp-paredit) (recommended for advanced users)
